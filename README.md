# NotVim
A terminal-based text editor developed in Java and inspired in Vim. 
This project was developed from the ground without using any dependency
The objective of this project was to create an entire text editor from the ground without using any dependcies *1 .


# Features

## Modes
> NotVim has four different modes, each one is used to perform different actions in the editor. 

### Normal mode:
Normal mode is accessed by pressing the `ESC` key at any time. With this mode you can move the cursor trough the text and access other modes.

### Insert mode:
This mode is used to insert text into a new or existing file. You can access it by pressing the letter `i` while in *normal mode*.

### Command mode:
In command mode

## Installation

Because the application is still under development, the only way to install it is by cloning this repo and building the executable with maven.

With the realese of `version 1.0`, a more easier way of installation will be provided in this section.

> Keep in mind that NotVim was only tested on unix, and I can't guarantee that it will work on Windows.
